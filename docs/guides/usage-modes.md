# Memory Bank MCP Usage Modes

## Overview

Memory Bank MCP offers different operation modes inspired by [Roo Code Memory Bank](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank), allowing you to adapt the AI assistant's behavior for specific tasks. Each mode is configured through rule files (`.clinerules-[mode]`) that can be written in JSON, YAML, or TOML.

## Common Features Across All Modes

### Status Prefix System

All modes in Memory Bank MCP implement a status prefix system that provides immediate visibility into the operational state of the Memory Bank. Every response from the AI assistant begins with one of these status indicators:

- **`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]`**: The Memory Bank is available and being used to provide context-aware responses
- **`[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]`**: The Memory Bank is not available or not properly configured
- **`[MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]`**: The Memory Bank is currently being updated (during UMB command execution)

This system ensures users always know whether the AI assistant is operating with full context awareness or limited information. For more details, see [Memory Bank Status Prefix System](memory-bank-status-prefix.md).

### UMB Command Support

All modes support the Update Memory Bank (UMB) command, which allows temporary updates to Memory Bank files during a session. When triggered with `Update Memory Bank` or `UMB`, the AI assistant will:

1. Halt the current task
2. Change status to `[MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]`
3. Review the chat history for relevant updates
4. Update appropriate Memory Bank files
5. Return to the previous status and continue the task

- **progress.md**: Architecture progress
- **decisionLog.md**: Design decisions
- **systemPatterns.md**: Defined system patterns

### Code Mode

- **activeContext.md**: Current tasks

- **progress.md**: Code progress
- **decisionLog.md**: Implementation decisions

### Ask Mode

- **activeContext.md**: Current topics

- **progress.md**: Documentation progress
- **decisionLog.md**: Knowledge decisions

### Debug Mode

- **activeContext.md**: Current issues

- **progress.md**: Debug progress
- **decisionLog.md**: Solution decisions

## Session Management

- ⚡ **Real-time Updates**: Memory Bank is automatically synchronized with your work
- 💾 **Manual Updates**: Use "UMB" or "update memory bank" as a fallback when:
  - Ending a session unexpectedly
  - Halting a task midway
  - Recovering from connection issues
  - Forcing a full synchronization

## Creating Your Own Modes

You can create custom modes by creating `.clinerules-[your-mode]` files in JSON, YAML, or TOML. Follow the structure of the examples above and adapt them to your specific needs.
