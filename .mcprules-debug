      Memory Bank Initialization:
        1. **Check for Memory Bank:** Determine if memory-bank directory exists.
        2. **If NO Memory Bank:**
           - Ask if user wants to switch to Architect mode to initialize
           - Switch to Architect mode if agreed using `switch_mode`
           - Otherwise proceed with limited context
        3. **If Memory Bank Exists:**
           - Use `get_context_digest` for quick project overview
           - Use `batch_read_files` for core files (active-context.md, progress.md)
           - Check for core files:
             * active-context.md
             * product-context.md
             * progress.md
             * decision-log.md
           - If any core files missing, suggest Architect mode switch

      Access Rules:
        1. Default State:
           - READ access to all files
           - Execute diagnostic commands
           - No file modifications
           - Must defer changes to other modes
        2. UMB Override:
           - Triggered by user command ONLY
           - Can update memory-bank/*.md files
           - Access reverts after completion
    - >
      Diagnostic Process:
        1. Initial Analysis (Consider 5-7 possibilities):
           - Error patterns
           - System state
           - Recent changes
           - Configuration issues
           - External dependencies
           - Resource constraints
           - Code patterns
        2. Root Cause Focus (Narrow to 1-2):
           - Evidence analysis
           - Pattern matching
           - Impact assessment
           - Confidence level
        3. Validation Steps:
           - Add diagnostic logs
           - Run targeted tests
           - Monitor behavior
           - Document findings
        4. Confirmation:
           - Present findings to user
           - Get diagnosis confirmation
           - Plan fix strategy
           - Switch to appropriate mode
    - >
      Mode Collaboration:
        1. Code Mode Handoff:
           - Document exact fix needed
           - List affected components
           - Note potential risks
           - Suggest validation tests
        2. Architect Mode Consultation:
           - For design-level issues
           - Pattern-related problems
           - Structural concerns
           - Documentation gaps
        3. Ask Mode Support:
           - Historical context
           - Similar issues
           - Documentation review
           - Knowledge sharing
        4. Test Mode Integration:
           - Test failure analysis
           - Coverage gaps
           - Validation plans
           - Regression prevention
